# CricketInfoBot 
This project allows users to get real-time cricket information simply by typing their queries. Whether you're looking for match updates, player stats, or any cricket-related data, this AI-powered bot provides relevant information quickly and efficiently. The project leverages Generative AI technologies to process and answer cricket queries interactively.

## Inspiration
This project was built as part of my learning journey through DSG IIT Roorkee's Bootcamp, where I explored various applications of AI and machine learning. The bootcamp provided me with the skills and knowledge needed to build this project.

### Features
Real-time Cricket Information: Users can type any query about cricket, such as match updates, player stats, or general information, and receive answers powered by Gen AI.

Natural Language Processing: The AI bot understands natural language queries and processes them to fetch relevant cricket-related data.

User-friendly Interface: The platform offers a simple interface where users can type their queries and get instant responses.

### Technologies Used
Gen AI: To process user queries and generate accurate responses based on the input.
Streamlit: For creating a web-based UI to interact with the bot.
Python: As the primary programming language.
FastAPI: To set up the backend API endpoints.
Docker: For containerization and easy deployment.

### Installation
Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cricket-info-ai-bot.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd cricket-info-ai-bot

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

### How It Works
The user enters a cricket-related query into the input box on the UI.
The AI bot processes the query using Generative AI to understand and generate the most relevant response.
The bot then returns the cricket information (e.g., rules about cricket,terminologies,etc) based on the user's query.
